        <h1>Gremlin Ownership Regulations</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Because nothing says "fun pet ownership" like a mountain of paperwork and constant paranoia!</p>

        <section class="reg-section">
            <h2>General Gremlin Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All gremlins must be registered with the Gremlin Group within 30 days of acquisition or birth. Failure to do so may result in your gremlin unionizing.</li>
                <li>Gremlins must be provided with adequate living space, nutrition, and enrichment activities. Tip: They find tax forms particularly enriching.</li>
                <li>Regular health check-ups with a licensed magical veterinarian are mandatory. Yes, even if your gremlin insists it's just a phase.</li>
                <li>Gremlin owners are responsible for their creature's actions and any resulting damages. Including, but not limited to, spontaneous dance parties and glitter explosions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="reg-section">
            <h2>The Three Golden Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Bright Light:</strong> Exposure to bright light will hurt a gremlin. Sunlight can kill it. Much like software developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Get Them Wet:</strong> Keep gremlins away from water. Even tiny amounts can cause them to multiply. Think of them as furry Mogwai-flavored Gremlins.</li>
                <li><strong>No Feeding After Midnight:</strong> Never, ever feed a gremlin after midnight, local time. This rule is absolute. But feel free to feed them your midnight existential dread.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warning">Warning: Violation of these golden rules may result in severe consequences, including rapid gremlin multiplication, transformation, and potential magical disasters. On the bright side, you might get a movie deal.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="reg-section">
            <h2>Public Interaction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Gremlins must be leashed or contained when in public spaces. No, your gremlin's promise to "be good" doesn't count.</li>
                <li>Gremlin-friendly establishments must display proper signage and adhere to safety protocols. "Enter at your own risk" is not considered proper signage.</li>
                <li>It is illegal to discriminate against individuals accompanied by registered gremlin companions. Even if the gremlin has better fashion sense than you.</li>
                <li>Public gremlin performances or exhibitions require a special permit. Impromptu karaoke does not count as a performance... usually.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="reg-section">
            <h2>Magical Use and Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use of gremlins for magical purposes requires a valid Magical Practices Permit. No, "making things disappear" doesn't count as a magical purpose. That's just called "mess."</li>
                <li>Enchanting gremlins with additional magical properties is strictly regulated and requires approval. Giving them a wizard hat doesn't count as enchantment.</li>
                <li>Gremlins must not be used in any form of combat or aggressive magical applications. Pillow fights are still under review.</li>
                <li>Breeding of gremlins for magical enhancement is prohibited without proper licensing. This includes attempts to create a "super-cuddly" breed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="reg-section">
            <h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Suspected violations of gremlin regulations should be reported to the Gremlin Group hotline immediately. Unless it's 3 AM and your neighbor's gremlin is having a dance party. Then it's a noise complaint.</li>
                <li>Magical Law Enforcement Officers are authorized to inspect gremlin living conditions and enforce regulations. They're not authorized to judge your interior decorating choices, though.</li>
                <li>Penalties for regulation violations may include fines, mandatory education programs, or revocation of gremlin ownership rights. Extreme cases may result in being forced to watch educational gremlin safety videos on repeat.</li>
